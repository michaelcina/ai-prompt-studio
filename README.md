About The Project
The AI Prompt Studio is an educational tool designed to help both novices and experts master the art of prompt engineering. It transforms the complex process of designing effective AI prompts into a simple, guided workflow. By breaking down prompt creation into four key steps—Goal, Rules, Example, and Content—the app empowers users to build structured, precise, and powerful prompts that get better results from any large language model.

Key Features
Guided Wizard: An interactive wizard to help you get started with pre-built templates for common tasks.

Step-by-Step Builder: A clear, four-step process that teaches the core concepts of prompt engineering.

AI-Assisted Examples: If you're stuck, the AI can help you create a high-quality example based on your goal.

Real-Time Generation: See your final prompt update instantly as you make changes.

Live Testing: Test your completed prompt with a real AI model directly within the app to see how it performs.

Drag-and-Drop Templates: Organize your favorite templates for quick access.
